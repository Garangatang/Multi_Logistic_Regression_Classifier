# REHABILITATION ASSESSMENTS WITH WEARABLE SENSORS: A NOVEL APPROACH FOR LOWER EXTREMITY FRACTURES

This repository supports REHABILITATION ASSESSMENTS WITH WEARABLE SENSORS: A NOVEL APPROACH FOR LOWER EXTREMITY FRACTURES

## Contents

`Separated_Log_Reg_Method.py` is a python file with the method used to train 5 separate binary logistic regression classifiers. The probabilities from the five logistic regression classifiers are all output together so the classification with the highest probability can be selected.

`relabeled_Tbl_500.txt` contains the data used to train all 5 binary logistic regression classifiers.

`Table_500_5g.txt` contains the data used to test the accuracy of using 5 binary logistic regression classifiers by selecting the classification with the highest probability.

## Python Versions
This code is compatible with Python 3.9.7 and above.
